# Identifying-Enron-POIs-with-sklearn
From a dictionary of Enron financial and email data, find an algorithm that identifies which employees are likely to have committed fraud.

The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning algorithm that correctly identifies persons of interest (POIs) implicated in the Enron fraud scandal using a subset of the emails in the Enron Email Dataset. Using the data contained in the certain features of the dataset, this algorithm will train on a subset of total individuals. Then it will create a model that will predict whether or not a given individual is a POI. We will fine-tune and modify the algorithm as needed to avoid bias and variance issues and evaluate the model for accuracy.
